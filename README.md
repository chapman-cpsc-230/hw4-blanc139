## Description

Fourth Homework Assignment. Various problems from the textbook.

## What I Learned from This

Performed multiple exercises, some exercises from the textbook and some from classwork. Learned how to use and test functions, and I not have a better understanding of "For" loops.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

Grayden Blanchard
